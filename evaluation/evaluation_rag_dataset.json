                "Earnings per share (EPS) is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company. It is a key measure of corporate profitability and is commonly used to price stocks.In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires EPS information for the four major categories of the income statement: continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and net income.\n\n\n== Calculation ==\nPreferred stock rights have precedence over common stock. Therefore, dividends on preferred shares are subtracted before calculating the EPS. When preferred shares are cumulative (i.e. dividends accumulate as payable if unpaid in the given accounting year), annual dividends are deducted whether or not they have been declared. Dividends in arrears are not relevant when calculating EPS.\n\nBasic formula\nEarnings per share = profit \u2212 preferred dividends/weighted average common sharesNet income formula\nEarnings per share = net income \u2212 preferred dividends/average common sharesContinuing operations formula\nEarnings per share = income from continuing operations \u2212 preferred dividends/weighted average common shares\n\n\n== Diluted earnings per share ==\nDiluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding (i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds). Diluted EPS indicates a \"worst case\" scenario, one that reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities that would reduce earnings per share.\n\n\n=== Calculations ===\nCalculations of diluted EPS vary. Morningstar reports diluted EPS \"Earnings/Share $\", which is net income minus preferred stock dividends divided by the weighted average of common stock shares outstanding over the past year; this is adjusted for dilutive shares. Some data sources may simplify this calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a reporting period. The methods of simplifying EPS calculations and eliminating inappropriate assumptions include replacing primary EPS with basic EPS, eliminating the treasury stock method of accounting from fully diluted EPS, eliminating the three-percent test for dual presentation, and providing information on individual dilative securities.\n\n\n=== U.S. GAAP ===\nCalculations of diluted EPS under U.S. GAAP are described under Statement No. 128 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FAS No. 128). The objective of diluted EPS is to measure the performance of a company over the reporting period taking into account the dilutive effect of potential common stock that could be issued by the company.  To compute diluted EPS, both the denominator (outstanding shares) and the numerator (earnings) may need to be adjusted.\nDiluted shares: \nTo calculate the total number of shares used in the calculation, FASB prescribes using the treasury method to calculate the dilutive effect of any instruments that could result in the issuance of shares, including:\n\nStock options\nWarrants\nConvertible preferred stock\nConvertible bonds\nShare-based payment arrangements\nWritten put options\nContingently issuable sharesEarnings: \nThe numerator used in calculating diluted EPS is adjusted to take into account the impact that the conversion of any securities would have on earnings.  For example, interest would be added back to earnings to reflect the conversion of any outstanding convertible bonds, preferred dividends would be added back to reflect the conversion of convertible preferred stock, and any impact of these changes on other financial items, such as royalties and taxes, would also be adjusted.\nAs mentioned above, a helpful way to consider the effect of dilutive instruments on EPS is to think about the \"as if\" method; in the sense that \"if the instrument is converted, how does it affect EPS?\" For example, let Campany XYZ have Net Income = $2,000,000, there are 50,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and $1,000,000 of 10% bonds, convertible into 50,000 shares of common stock. Company A's tax rate is 25%.\nBasic EPS = ($2,000,000 - ($1,000,000*10%))/50,000 = $38 \nDiluted EPS = ($2,000,000 + (25%*($1,000,000*10%))) / 50,000 + 50,000 = $20.25\nNote that other than accounting for the shares of common stock added in the denominator of the EPS equation, we also add back the taxes that would have been taken out from Net income if the bonds were not converted. In conclusion, the \"as if\" method is helpful in considering the effect on dilutive instruments on EPS because it helps us think about the overall effect rather than just thinking about the numerator and denominator of the equation separately."

                "A financial ratio or accounting ratio states the relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. If shares in a company are traded in a financial market, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\nRatios can be expressed as a decimal value, such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n\n\n== Sources of data ==\nValues used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n\n\n== Purpose and types ==\n\nFinancial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis. Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures. Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt. Activity ratios measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets. Debt ratios measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. Profitability ratios measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock.\nThese are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\nFinancial ratios allow for comparisons\n\nbetween companies\nbetween industries\nbetween different time periods for one company\nbetween a single company and its industry average\nRatios generally are not useful unless they are benchmarked against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\n\n\n== Accounting methods and principles ==\nFinancial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different accounting methods or follow various standard accounting practices. Most public companies are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships may elect to not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\nThere is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\n\n\n== Types of Ratio Comparisons ==\nAn important of ration analysis is interpreting ratio values. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed to answer questions such as \"Is it too high or too low?\" or \"Is it good or bad?\". Two types pf ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series.\n\n\n=== Cross-Sectional Analysis ===\nCross-sectional analysis compares the financial ratios of different companies at the same point in time. It allows companies to benchmark from other competitors by comparing their ratio values to similar companies in the industry.\n\n\n=== Time-Series Analysis ===\nTime-series analysis evaluates a company's performance over time. It compares its current performance against past or historical performance. This can help assess the company's progress by looking into developing trends or year-to-year changes."

                "A financial ratio or accounting ratio states the relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. If shares in a company are traded in a financial market, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\nRatios can be expressed as a decimal value, such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n\n\n== Sources of data ==\nValues used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n\n\n== Purpose and types ==\n\nFinancial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis.

                "In finance, the Sharpe ratio (also known as the Sharpe index, the Sharpe measure, and the reward-to-variability ratio) measures the performance of an investment such as a security or portfolio compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment returns. It represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.\nIt was named after William F. Sharpe, who developed it in 1966.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nSince its revision by the original author, William Sharpe, in 1994, the ex-ante Sharpe ratio is defined as:\n\nSa=E[Ra\u2212Rb]\u03c3a=E[Ra\u2212Rb]var[Ra\u2212Rb],{\\displaystyle S_{a}={\\frac {E[R_{a}-R_{b}]}{\\sigma _{a}}}={\\frac {E[R_{a}-R_{b}]}{\\sqrt {\\mathrm {var} [R_{a}-R_{b}]}}},}where Ra{\\displaystyle R_{a}} is the asset return, Rb{\\displaystyle R_{b}} is the risk-free return (such as a U.S. Treasury security).  E[Ra\u2212Rb]{\\displaystyle E[R_{a}-R_{b}]} is the expected value of the excess of the asset return over the benchmark return, and \u03c3a{\\displaystyle {\\sigma _{a}}} is the standard deviation of the asset excess return. The t-statistic will equal the Sharpe Ratio times the square root of T (the number of returns used for the calculation).\nThe ex-post Sharpe ratio uses the same equation as the one above but with realized returns of the asset and benchmark rather than expected returns; see the second example below.\nThe information ratio is a generalization of the Sharpe ratio that uses as benchmark some other, typically risky index rather than using risk-free returns.\n\n\n== Use in finance ==\nThe Sharpe ratio seeks to characterize how well the return of an asset compensates the investor for the risk taken.  When comparing two assets, the one with a higher Sharpe ratio appears to provide better return for the same risk, which is usually attractive to investors.However, financial assets are often not normally distributed, so that standard deviation does not capture all aspects of risk.  Ponzi schemes, for example, will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until they fail. Similarly, a fund that sells low-strike put options will have a high empirical Sharpe ratio until one of those puts is exercised, creating a large loss. In both cases, the empirical standard deviation before failure gives no real indication of the size of the risk being run.Even in less extreme cases, a reliable empirical estimate of Sharpe ratio still requires the collection of return data over sufficient period for all aspects of the strategy returns to be observed. For example, data must be taken over decades if the algorithm sells an insurance that involves a high liability payout once every 5\u201310 years, and a high-frequency trading algorithm may only require a week of data if each trade occurs every 50 milliseconds, with care taken toward risk from unexpected but rare results that such testing did not capture (see flash crash).\nAdditionally, when examining the investment performance of assets with smoothing of returns (such as with-profits funds), the Sharpe ratio should be derived from the performance of the underlying assets rather than the fund returns (Such a model would invalidate the aforementioned Ponzi scheme, as desired).\nSharpe ratios, along with Treynor ratios and Jensen's alphas, are often used to rank the performance of portfolio or mutual fund managers.  Berkshire Hathaway had a Sharpe ratio of 0.76 for the period 1976 to 2011, higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years. The stock market had a Sharpe ratio of 0.39 for the same period.\n\n\n== Tests ==\nSeveral statistical tests of the Sharpe ratio have been proposed.

                "== Strengths and weaknesses ==\nA negative Sharpe ratio means the portfolio has underperformed its benchmark. All other things being equal, an investor typically prefers a higher positive Sharpe ratio as it has either higher returns or lower volatility. However, a negative Sharpe ratio can be made higher by either increasing returns (a good thing) or increasing volatility (a bad thing). Thus, for negative values the Sharpe ratio does not correspond well to typical investor utility functions.\nThe Sharpe ratio is convenient because it can be calculated purely from any observed series of returns without need for additional information surrounding the source of profitability. However, this makes it vulnerable to manipulation if opportunities exist for smoothing or discretionary pricing of illiquid assets. Statistics such as the bias ratio and first order autocorrelation are sometimes used to indicate the potential presence of these problems.\nWhile the Treynor ratio considers only the systematic risk of a portfolio, the Sharpe ratio considers both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. Which one is more relevant will depend on the portfolio context.\nThe returns measured can be of any frequency (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly or annually), as long as they are normally distributed, as the returns can always be annualized. Herein lies the underlying weakness of the ratio - asset returns are not normally distributed. Abnormalities like kurtosis, fatter tails and higher peaks, or skewness on the distribution can be problematic for the ratio, as standard deviation doesn't have the same effectiveness when these problems exist.For Brownian walk, Sharpe ratio \u03bc/\u03c3{\\displaystyle \\mu /\\sigma } is a dimensional quantity and has units 1/T{\\displaystyle 1/{\\sqrt {T}}}, because the excess return \u03bc{\\displaystyle \\mu } and the volatility \u03c3{\\displaystyle \\sigma } are proportional to 1/T{\\displaystyle 1/{\\sqrt {T}}} and 1/T{\\displaystyle 1/T} correspondingly. Kelly criterion is a dimensionless quantity, and, indeed, Kelly fraction \u03bc/\u03c32{\\displaystyle \\mu /\\sigma ^{2}} is the numerical fraction of wealth suggested for the investment.\nIn some settings, the Kelly criterion can be used to convert the Sharpe ratio into a rate of return. The Kelly criterion gives the ideal size of the investment, which when adjusted by the period and expected rate of return per unit, gives a rate of return.The accuracy of Sharpe ratio estimators hinges on the statistical properties of returns, and these properties can vary considerably among strategies, portfolios, and over time.\n\n\n=== Drawback as fund selection criteria ===\nBailey and L\u00f3pez de Prado (2012) show that Sharpe ratios tend to be overstated in the case of hedge funds with short track records. These authors propose a probabilistic version of the Sharpe ratio that takes into account the asymmetry and fat-tails of the returns' distribution. With regards to the selection of portfolio managers on the basis of their Sharpe ratios, these authors have proposed a Sharpe ratio indifference curve This curve illustrates the fact that it is efficient to hire portfolio managers with low and even negative Sharpe ratios, as long as their correlation to the other portfolio managers is sufficiently low.\nGoetzmann, Ingersoll, Spiegel, and Welch (2002) determined that the best strategy to maximize a portfolio's Sharpe ratio, when both securities and options contracts on these securities are available for investment, is a portfolio of selling one out-of-the-money call and selling one out-of-the-money put. This portfolio generates an immediate positive payoff, has a large probability of generating modestly high returns, and has a small probability of generating huge losses. Shah (2014) observed that such a portfolio is not suitable for many investors, but fund sponsors who select fund managers primarily based on the Sharpe ratio will give incentives for fund managers to adopt such a strategy.In recent years, many financial websites have promoted the idea that a Sharpe Ratio \"greater than 1 is considered acceptable; a ratio higher than 2.0 is considered very good; and a ratio above 3.0 is excellent.\"  While it is unclear where this rubric originated online, it makes little sense since the magnitude of the Sharpe ratio is sensitive to the time period over which the underlying returns are measured.  This is because the nominator of the ratio (returns) scales in proportion to time; while the denominator of the ratio (standard deviation) scales in proportion to the square root of time.  Most diversified indexes of equities, bonds, mortgages or commodities have annualized Sharpe ratios below 1, which suggests that a Sharpe ratio consistently above 2.0 or 3.0 is unrealistic."

                "The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a financial term used by lenders to express the ratio of a loan to the value of an asset purchased. \nIn real estate, the term is commonly used by banks and building societies to represent the ratio of the first mortgage line as a percentage of the total appraised value of real property. For instance, if someone borrows $130,000 to purchase a house worth $150,000, the LTV ratio is $130,000 to 150,000 or $130,000/$150,000, or 87%. The remaining 13% represent the lender's haircut, adding up to 100% and being covered from the borrower's equity. The higher the LTV ratio, the riskier the loan is for a lender.\nThe valuation of a property is typically determined by an appraiser, but a better measure is an arms-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Typically, banks will utilize the lesser of the appraised value and purchase price if the purchase is \"recent\" (within 1\u20132 years).\n\n\n== Risk ==\nLoan to value is one of the key risk factors that lenders assess when qualifying borrowers for a mortgage. The risk of default is always at the forefront of lending decisions, and the likelihood of a lender absorbing a loss increases as the amount of equity decreases. Therefore, as the LTV ratio of a loan increases, the qualification guidelines for certain mortgage programs become much more strict. Lenders can require borrowers of high LTV loans to buy mortgage insurance to protect the lender from the buyer's default, which increases the costs of the mortgage.\nLow LTV ratios (below 80%) may carry with them lower rates for lower-risk borrowers and allow lenders to consider higher-risk borrowers, such as those with low credit scores, previous late payments in their mortgage history, high debt-to-income ratios, high loan amounts or cash-out requirements, insufficient reserves and/or no income. However, an LTV higher than 80% may carry Mortgage Insurance requirements, which will in turn offer the borrower a lower interest rate.  Higher LTV ratios are primarily reserved for borrowers with higher credit scores and a satisfactory mortgage history. Full financing, or 100% LTV, is reserved for only the most credit-worthy borrowers. The loans with LTV ratios higher than 100% are called underwater mortgages.\n\n\n== Combined loan to value ratio ==\nCombined loan to value ratio (CLTV) is the proportion of loans (secured by a property) in relation to its value. The term \"combined loan to value\" adds additional specificity to the basic loan to value which simply indicates the ratio between one primary loan and the property value. When \"combined\" is added, it indicates that additional loans on the property have been considered in the calculation of the percentage ratio.\nThe aggregate principal balance(s) of all mortgages on a property divided by its appraised value or purchase price, whichever is less. Distinguishing CLTV from LTV serves to identify loan scenarios that involve more than one mortgage. For example, a property valued at $100,000 with a single mortgage of $50,000 has an LTV of 50%. A similar property with a value of $100,000 with a first mortgage of $50,000 and a second mortgage of $25,000 has an aggregate mortgage balance of $75,000. The CLTV is 75%.\nCombined loan to value is an amount in addition to the Loan to Value, which simply represents the first position mortgage or loan as a percentage of the property's value.\n\n\n== Countries ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, conforming loans that meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines are limited to an LTV ratio that is less than or equal to 80%. Conforming loans above 80% are allowed but typically require private mortgage insurance. Other over-80% LTV loan options exist as well. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures purchase loans to 96.5% and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Agriculture guarantee purchase loans to 100%.\nProperties with more than one lien, such as a second lien, are subject to combined loan to value (CLTV) criteria. The CLTV for a property valued at $100,000 with a $50,000 first mortgage and a home equity lines of credit (HELOC) balance of $10,000 would be the 60% ($50,000 + $10,000)/$100,000. The LTV for the stand-alone seconds and Home Equity Line of Credit would be the loan balance as a percentage of the appraised value.  However, in order to measure the riskiness of the borrower, one should look at all outstanding mortgage debt."

                "=== Australia ===\nIn the Australian financial context, the loan-to-value ratio (LVR) is a critical metric in the mortgage industry. Typically, an LVR of 80% or lower is deemed low risk for conforming loans, and 60% and below for a no doc loan or low doc loan. Unique to the Australian market is the availability of higher LVR loans, which can extend up to 95% with mortgage insurance and even 100% LVR loans under certain conditions. These 100% LVR loans, designed for buyers without a deposit, are contingent upon stringent requirements, including a guarantor, also known as a Guarantor home loan. This flexibility in LVR reflects the market's capacity to cater to a diverse range of borrowing needs while balancing the inherent risks associated with high LVR lending.\nThe structure of LVR in Australia, particularly for high LVR loans, showcases the evolving dynamics of real estate financing. The option of high LVR loans expands access to property ownership but also introduces increased risk for both lenders and borrowers. Managing these risks, especially in the context of 100% LVR loans, is critical to the Australian mortgage sector. It underscores the market's nuanced approach to promoting homeownership while maintaining financial stability, primarily through risk mitigation strategies like guarantor-backed loans.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn New Zealand, the Reserve Bank has introduced Loan-to-Value restrictions on the banks in order to slow the rapidly growing property market - particularly in Auckland. The LVR restrictions mean that banks are not permitted to make more than 10 percent of their residential mortgage lending to high-LVR (less than 20 percent deposit) owner-occupier borrowers and they must restrict their high-LVR (less than 40 percent deposit) lending to investors to no more than 5 percent of residential mortgage lending.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the UK, mortgages with an LTV of up to 125% were quite common in the run-up to the national / global economic problems, but today (November 2011) there are very few mortgages available with an LTV of over 90% - and 75% LTV mortgages are the most common.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollateral (finance)\nCross-collateralization\nHaircut (finance)\nMortgage law\nMortgage loan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMortgage Lenders ease Rules for Home Buyers in Hun The Wall Street Journal"

This flexibility in LVR reflects the market's capacity to cater to a diverse range of borrowing needs while balancing the inherent risks associated with high LVR lending.\nThe structure of LVR in Australia, particularly for high LVR loans, showcases the evolving dynamics of real estate financing. The option of high LVR loans expands access to property ownership but also introduces increased risk for both lenders and borrowers.

                "The price-to-book ratio, or P/B ratio, is a financial ratio used to compare a company's current market value to its book value (where book value is the value of all assets minus liabilities owned by a company). The calculation can be performed in two ways, but the result should be the same. In the first way, the company's market capitalization can be divided by the company's total book value from its balance sheet. The second way, using per-share values, is to divide the company's current share price by the book value per share (i.e. its book value divided by the number of outstanding shares). It is also known as the market-to-book ratio and the price-to-equity ratio (which should not be confused with the price-to-earnings ratio), and its inverse is called the book-to-market ratio.\nAs with most ratios, it varies a fair amount by industry. Industries that require more infrastructure capital (for each dollar of profit) will usually trade at P/B ratios much lower than, for example, consulting firms. P/B ratios are commonly used to compare banks, because most assets and liabilities of banks are constantly valued at market values. A higher P/B ratio implies that investors  expect management to create more value from a given set of assets, all else equal (and/or that the market value of the firm's assets is significantly higher than their accounting value). P/B ratios do not, however, directly provide any information on the ability of the firm to generate profits or cash for shareholders.\nThis ratio also gives some idea of whether an investor is paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately. For companies in distress, the book value is usually calculated without the intangible assets that would have no resale value. In such cases, P/B should also be calculated on a \"diluted\" basis, because stock options may well vest on sale of the company or change of control or firing of management.\n\n\n== Total book value vs tangible book value ==\nTechnically, P/B can be calculated either including or excluding intangible assets and goodwill.  When intangible assets and goodwill are excluded, the ratio is often specified to be \"price to tangible book value\" or \"price to tangible book\".\nSee also Return on tangible equity.\n\n\n== Applications and limitations ==\nIn the 1920s and '30s when investors like Benjamin Graham outlined the concepts of value investing and estimating a company's value, book values were more relevant than in later years. Most companies in this era had significant investments in tangible assets, and such assets comprised the bulk of the value of the company. The value of today's companies, other than asset based companies like investment trusts and property companies, is very different from the book values and there is often no relationship between their intrinsic values and their book values. In his 2000 annual report, Graham disciple Warren Buffett said \"In all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of value\".Except in the case of a small minority of companies, like property companies and investment trusts that are asset-based, book values can bear little or no relationship to true values of the companies. The items on a company's balance sheet are the result of various transactions, recorded using double-entry bookkeeping at a particular point in time, to the extent that they do not form part of the profit and loss account to that point in time. The assets and liabilities comprising the book value are mainly stated at historic cost though a few items therein may be stated at valuations.\nIn many of today's companies, their most valuable assets are not shown on the balances sheet and are therefore not necessarily reflected in the company's book value. In these types of companies, factors such as copyrights, intellectual capital, internally generated goodwill, or brand awareness are much more valuable than the tangible assets listed on their balance sheets. This generally leads the company's market value to be higher than its book value.Despite the limitations of the price-book ratio, academic research has repeatedly shown that stocks with low price-book ratios tend to outperform stocks with high price-book ratios in the United States and other nations. Eugene Fama and Kenneth French incorporated a price-book term in their influential three factor model. Penman Richardson and Tuna (2013) show how the price-to-book ratio can be decomposed into financing and operating components. Foye and Mramor (2016) show that while stocks with low price-book ratios normally outperform, the ratios decomposed elements exhibit a different relationship with returns in different countries, implying that the price-book ratio may have a country-specific interpretation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTobin's q\n\n\n== References =="
